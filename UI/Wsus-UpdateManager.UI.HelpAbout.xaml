                    WSUS Update Manager is designed to allow administrators an easy way to query updates and approvals for different Computer Target Groups. It was created as I found that managing updates that had been approved for a test group in the WSUS console was difficult, and needed something interactive and efficient to manage updates which may have staged approvals (e.g test and production groups on the same WSUS instance).

                    The tool requires that the WSUS RSAT tool is installed on the system that it is being run from. You will also need permissions to access the WSUS instance.

                    You will need to run the tool as a user that has access to the WSUS instance. I could not find a way through the API to specify alternate credentials to use when connecting. In most installations you will just need to specify the hostname of the server running WSUS. Once you have entered the details, select Connect. If the connection is successful then details about the available Target Computer Groups will be loaded along with updates categories and classifications.

                    In the Filters section choose the updates and computer group that you want to review approvals for. Choosing a classification or category can reduce the amount of time taken to load updates. Click 'Get Update Details' when complete.

                    The updates will be retrieved from the WSUS database and details loaded into the 'Manage Updates' panel. This can take a couple of minutes (tests loaded details of 21000 updates in around 90 seconds).

                    This panel allows you to see details of all updates and the approvals for the selected Computer Group. The Approval State field can be one of 3 values:

                            Approved: This shows that the update has an approval for the current computer group. It also shows the action that the approval was given for and in brackets the Computer Group that the approval was given on. This shows whether the approval was given for the current group or a parent group and shows inheritance of updates.

                    Updates can be approved for 1 of 3 actions: 
	- Install
	- Uninstall
	- Not Approved
	
The Not Approved option exists to allow you to override an inherited Install or Uninstall action on a child group without needed to Decline the update. 

When approving updates you are given the option to approve the update on either the currently selected Computer Group or on any of the parent Computer Groups.
